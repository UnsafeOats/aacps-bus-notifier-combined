# Bogus Sample Folder

These are not the droids (\*programs\*) you're looking for.  This folder just exists so GitHub can detect that the repo is split between Python and Rust as GitHub doesn't include submodules in the language collection.

I'm just a man trynna make the only recognized language in my repo be a markdown file **:(**
